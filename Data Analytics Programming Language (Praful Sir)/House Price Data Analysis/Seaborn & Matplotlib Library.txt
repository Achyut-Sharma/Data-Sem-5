packages to visulaize datasets

matplotlib

seaborn

seaborn is used for visualization of datasets. 

import seaborn as sns

sns.bar(x=[col1],y=[col2])

here bar is type of graph convert col1 into series and according to coordinates it maps them into graph same for  y coordinates.

At a time maximum 3 coordinates ca be in a plot.


Matplotlib

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

here "pyplot" is sub package 



** How to interpretation Of Pairplot:-

(1)Pairplot compare all the numeric columns 

eg:

col1,col2,col3

convert them into matrix form

col1  col2  col3
col1xcol1 col2xcol1  col3xcol1
col1xcol2  col2xcol2 col3xcol2
col1xcol3   col2xcol3 col3xcol3



-> It helps to show relation between Numeric columns.

-> It shows linear relation.  (Line form)
->It show non-Linear relation. (Non line form)
->It shows density of the datapoints. (space between data)
->It will show the nature of the column or Data.
